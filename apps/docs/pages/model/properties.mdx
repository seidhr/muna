# Muna Propterties

Properties in **Muna**.

## Classified as

> This property allows sub typing of CRM entities - a form of specialisation – through the use of a terminological hierarchy, or thesaurus. The CRM is intended to focus on the high-level entities and relationships needed to describe data structures. Consequently, it does not specialise entities any further than is required for this immediate purpose. However, entities in the isA hierarchy of the CRM may by specialised into any number of sub entities, which can be defined in the E55 Type hierarchy. E51 Contact Point, for example, may be specialised into “e-mail address”, “telephone number”, “post office box”, “URL” etc. none of which figures explicitly in the CRM hierarchy. Sub typing obviously requires consistency between the meaning of the terms assigned and the more general intent of the CRM entity in question.

See [P2 has type](http://ontologies.dataforhistory.org/property/2)

## Activity stream

**Experimental**

The use of Activity stream in Muna is a way to combine the different properties in CIDOC-CRM concerning event connected to an entity. In the activity stream there is no out going property specifying the relation. The class or type in the Activity stream array is the important information. This can be mapped to CIDOC-CRM properties if needed. The `Production` document can be mapped to a `Object` -> `wasProducedBy` -> `Production`.

## Assessment

`assesment` is inspired by [P34 concerned ](http://ontologies.dataforhistory.org/property/32), but differs as it is used to point to a objects concerned with events triggered by a reports recommandations.

## Consists of

## Used general technique

> This property identifies the technique or method that was employed in an activity. These techniques should be drawn from an external E55 Type hierarchy of consistent terminology of general techniques or methods such as embroidery, oil-painting, carbon dating, etc. Specific documented techniques should be described as instances of E29 Design or Procedure. This property identifies the technique that was employed in an act of modification.

See [P32 used general technique](http://ontologies.dataforhistory.org/property/30)

## Used spesific technique

> This property identifies a specific instance of E29 Design or Procedure in order to carry out an instance of E7 Activity or parts of it. The property differs from P32 used general technique (was technique of) in that P33 refers to an instance of E29 Design or Procedure, which is a concrete information object in its own right rather than simply being a term or a method known by tradition. Typical examples would include intervention plans for conservation or the construction plans of a building.

See [P33 used specific technique](http://ontologies.dataforhistory.org/property/31)

## Used object of type

See [P33 used specific technique](http://ontologies.dataforhistory.org/property/31)

## Used spesific object

> This property describes the use of material or immaterial things in a way essential to the performance or the outcome of an E7 Activity. This property typically applies to tools, instruments, moulds, raw materials and items embedded in a product. It implies that the presence of the object in question was a necessary condition for the action. For example, the activity of writing this text required the use of a computer. An immaterial thing can be used if at least one of its carriers is present. For example, the software tools on a computer. Another example is the use of a particular name by a particular group of people over some span to identify a thing, such as a settlement. In this case, the physical carriers of this name are at least the people understanding its use.

See [P16 used specific object](http://ontologies.dataforhistory.org/property/15)

## Motivated by

> This property describes an item or items that are regarded as a reason for carrying out the E7 Activity. For example, the discovery of a large hoard of treasure may call for a celebration, an order from head quarters can start a military manoeuvre.
