* `collections`, `set` and their members, what to do?
    - Getting the `collection` should not return all members, or should it? No. Add a intermediate `set` between `collection` and `object`?
* Should these be localized or have separate translated documents?
    - `designOrProsedyre`
    - `timeline`
* QR code for printing? Yes, please! Custom inputcomponent? Print tool?
* `storage` needs some work
* Add `projectType`?
* Handle `owl:sameAs`? Custom input?
