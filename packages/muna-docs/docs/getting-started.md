**Muna** or **ᛗᚢᚾᚨ** means *remember* in norse is a schema plugin for [Sanity](https://sanity.io) that enables detailed descriptions of cultural heritage objects and knowledge about their contexts. Muna is inspired by [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) and [linked.art](https://linked.art). The goal is to enable anyone to describe objects without a costly application or infrastructure.

Muna tries to combine the expressiveness of CIDOC-CRM and the customizable editor Sanity. Objects can connected to events, actors, reports and loads more. If you have a good knowledge of CIDOC-CRM and is willing to try a rather untested schema here is the way to get started!

## Made for Sanity
Muna is a schema for [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/), a great editor able to bridge expressivness and useability.

## Inspired by CIDOC-CRM
CIDOC-CRM is a fantastic conceptual model, everybody is talking about it and Muna is heavily inspired by it. Well, not everyone is talking about it, some folks are. Checkout [linked.art](https://linked.art)!

## Some IIIF mixed in
Sanity supports the IIIF Image API and Muna adds the possibility to construct small IIIF Presentation manifests.
