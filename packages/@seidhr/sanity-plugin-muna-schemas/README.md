# sanity-plugin-muna-schemas

Muna or ᛗᚢᚾᚨ means remember in norse. Muna is a schema for the Sanity Studio that enables detailed descriptions of cultural heritage objects and knowledge about their contexts as well as pages about them (or anything else really.) 

Muna is inspired by CIDOC-CRM and linked.art. The goal is to enable anyone to describe objects without a costly application or infrastructure. Muna tries to combine the expressiveness of CIDOC-CRM and the customizable editor Sanity Studio. Objects can connected to events, actors, reports and loads more.
