**Muna** or **ᛗᚢᚾᚨ** means *remember* in norse. Muna is a schema and a Studio for [Sanity](https://sanity.io) that enables detailed descriptions of cultural heritage objects and knowledge about their contexts. Muna is inspired by [CIDOC-CRM](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/) and [linked.art](https://linked.art). The goal is to enable anyone to describe objects without a costly application or infrastructure.

Muna tries to combine the expressiveness of CIDOC-CRM and [the customizable editor Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/). Objects can connected to events, actors, reports and loads more. If you have a good knowledge of CIDOC-CRM and is willing to try a rather untested schema here is the [way to get started](installation.md)!
